Expressions
===========

First try at coding something that can actually be considered 'something'. I'm very new to coding at this is just my way to learn and explore. The code is pretty messy at the moment, I will tidy it up later. Corrections, comments and such are very welcome and will probably help me learn by knowing what I can do better.

You'll find all the files in the 'Files' branch.



Anyway, so, this is just a basic controller using "game" if you can call it that. I wouldn't really call it a game as it is more or less just making expressions on a Minecraft-ish character, but really the point of making this wasn't to create something that anybody would use, but it was more for my benefit, to help me learn and practice.
